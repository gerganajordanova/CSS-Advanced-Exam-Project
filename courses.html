            <h3>Intensive Drift Course</h3>
            <p>Two days of the most efficient and professional drift course to become a real drifter! From the basic
                drills of initiating a drift car to aggressive transitions maneuvers and a hi-speed smoky drifting in a
                track layout, this course has it all.


                With a ratio of 2 drivers per drift car and lots of practice time, the participants learn to control the
                drift techniques, understand the sport of drifting and progress to a competitive drifting level. An
                official license is issued to each graduate by the end of the course, which allows them to compete in a
                European drift competitions with team academy's support.</p>
