                <p>
                    Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction in the rear wheels or all tires, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner.
                </p>
                <p><b>As a sport</b></p>
                <p>Drifting has evolved into a competitive sport where drivers compete in rear-wheel-drive cars, to earn points from judges based on various factors such as speed, drift angle and line taken through set of corners. At the top levels of competition, the D1 Grand Prix in Japan pioneered the sport. Others such as Formula D in the United States and King of Europe in Europe, have come along to further expand it into a legitimate motor sport worldwide.​﻿</p>

                <p> Sofia is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. The city is at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country.
                    Sofia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Bulgaria alongside coastal and mountain resorts. Among its highlights is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, one of the symbols of Bulgaria, constructed in the late 19th century. It occupies an area of 3,170 square metres (34,122 square feet) and can hold 10,000 people.
                    Sofia is the perfect combination of rich history and the ultra-modern and is the ideal backdrop for your next extreme drift vacation. So what are you waiting for?</p>
