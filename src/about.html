                <p>
                    Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction in the rear wheels or all tires, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner.
                </p>
                <p><b>As a sport</b></p>
                <p>Drifting has evolved into a competitive sport where drivers compete in rear-wheel-drive cars, to earn points from judges based on various factors such as speed, drift angle and line taken through set of corners. At the top levels of competition, the D1 Grand Prix in Japan pioneered the sport. Others such as Formula D in the United States and King of Europe in Europe, have come along to further expand it into a legitimate motor sport worldwide.​﻿</p>
